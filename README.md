For this project, I used Power BI to build a simple interactive dashboard using the Walmart_Sales.xlsx data. I first cleaned the DATE column into a Month-Year format to easily see trends.

My dashboard has a Line Chart showing sales over months, a Bar Chart for sales by store, and a Donut Chart comparing holiday and non-holiday sales. I also added a slicer to filter by store or holiday weeks.

From this, I found that sales peak at the end of the year, especially in Q4, with November and December being the highest. Stores 20 and 4 bring in the most sales. Most sales come from non-holiday weeks, but holiday weeks still have big spikes. Overall, Walmartâ€™s sales drop in mid-year and rise again toward the holidays.

This dashboard makes it easy to see where and when sales perform best.
